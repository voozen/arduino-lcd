# arduino-lcd

This is a simple Arduino project I made using I2C LCD display, motion sensor and an ultrasonic sensor. It is my first try of writing any code by myself regarding microcontrollers, so some parts of it may look unconventional - or just outright stupid.
The program starts with a fake loading screen, then lets you choose if you wish to use the motion sensor or rather the ultrasonic one.

The wiring is rather messy, and you can clearly see that there were some dumb decisions involved - mostly due to lack of male-female jumper wires.
